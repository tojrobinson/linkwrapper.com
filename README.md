**linkwrapper** is a media link library that abstracts the players of various streaming services allowing you to save, search, and play all your links in one place. Notably, it allows you to convert your existing YouTube, Vimeo & SoundCloud bookmarks into a searchable and sortable library of playable streams.

The aim has been to take the qualities of traditional media libraries (Ã  la Winamp or iTunes) and implement them within an online and stream based context.

For more information, read through the [documentation](https://linkwrapper.com/docs/about).
